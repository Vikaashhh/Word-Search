# 🔍 Day 79 — GFG 160 Days DSA Challenge
### 💡 Problem: Word Search | DFS + Backtracking
### 📘 Problem Brief:
Given a 2D board and a word, determine if the word exists in the grid.
The word can be constructed from letters of sequentially adjacent cells — horizontally or vertically, with no cell used more than once.

## 🧠 My Approach:
✅ Used DFS (Depth-First Search) to explore all directions
✅ Applied backtracking to revert visited states
✅ Mutated board temporarily with a sentinel "#"
✅ Carefully managed bounds and base cases

## ✅ Submission Overview:
🔢 Test Cases Passed: 1088 / 1088

🔁 Attempts: 1 / 1

📈 Accuracy: 100%

🕐 Time Taken: 6.26s

🏆 Points Scored: 4 / 4

## 🔁 Key Takeaway:
Solving this required a balance between recursive depth control and state restoration. A simple DFS becomes powerful when paired with a clean rollback mechanism. 🔁💪
